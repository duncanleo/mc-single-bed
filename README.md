# mc-single-bed
This plugin allows a single player in the server to achieve day time by sleeping on a bed, instead of the default Minecraft behaviour of requiring everyone to sleep.

## Usage
To build a JAR file for use with Spigot, run `gradle shadowJar`. The completed file will be in `build/libs`.
